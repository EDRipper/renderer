 My project for #Hijack! ive been meaning to take on rust for a while and was pleasantly surprised by the experience. Its super readable and gives nice feedback from the compiler.
 The goal here is to make a wireframe renderer that takes a mesh from a .stl file and renders it with rotation and scaling in black and white.
 as of now i have the matrix maths and a graphics window but i need to hook the two up together, add importing and all that jazz.
